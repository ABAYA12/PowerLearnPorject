# 🪙 CryptoBuddy Chatbot 🤖

CryptoBuddy is a simple Python chatbot that helps users explore cryptocurrencies.  
It uses basic AI-style decision-making rules to recommend coins based on price trends,  
sustainability, and growth potential.

## 📖 Introduction
This project was built as part of a PLP Academy assignment to demonstrate how chatbots  
can mimic AI decision-making. The bot answers user queries such as:
- "Which crypto is trending up?"  
- "What’s the most sustainable coin?"  
- "Which coin should I buy for long-term growth?"  

CryptoBuddy analyzes a small predefined dataset of popular cryptocurrencies and responds  
with friendly, human-like advice.
